1. Code smell - devide nested loops and if statements to seperate funciton. Code should tell a story
2. Devide the Code to sperate directories by layer.
3. Reusability - refactor the filter_by_title function to call the filter_by_text\time functions
4. Do not reflect internal use between the Controller (business logic) and Routes the is shown to the outside user.
